## BlackJackProject
#### Python project made for a school assignment

This project was made by me and two classmates during our first week of CE.
the back end was created by me beforehand. we spent the week adding GUI and encrypted user log-in and
stored variables in a local text file.

since this was the first python project some of the participants made there are sevral bugs within the code.
Also, tkinter which is the module we used to display all the graphics is not particularly made for these kinds
of projects, the layout and grid on alot of the components did not turn out how they were supposed to.
